  "description": "Categories: Business Automation, Customer Support, AI, Knowledge ManagementThis comprehensive workflow enables businesses to build and deploy acustom-trained AI Chatbot in minutes. By combining a sophisticated data scrapingengine with a RAG-based (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chat interface, itallows you to transform website content into a high-performance support agent.Powered by Google Gemini and Pinecone, this system ensures your chatbot providesaccurate, real-time answers based exclusively on your business data.BENEFITS * Instant Knowledge Sync - Automatically crawls sitemaps and URLs to keep your AI up-to-date with your latest website content. * Embeddable Anywhere - Features a ready-to-use chat trigger that can be integrated into the bottom-right of any website via a simple script. * High-Fidelity Retrieval - Uses vector embeddings to ensure the AI \"searches\" your documentation before answering, reducing hallucinations. * Smart Conversational Memory - Equipped with a 10-message window buffer, allowing the bot to handle complex follow-up questions naturally. * Cost-Efficient Scaling - Leverages Gemini’s efficient API and Pinecone’s high-speed indexing to manage thousands of customer queries at a low cost.HOW IT WORKS 1. Dual-Path Ingestion: The process begins with an n8n Form where you provide a sitemap or individual URLs. The workflow automatically handles XML parsing and URL cleaning to prepare a list of pages for processing. 2. Clean Content Extraction: Using Decodo, the workflow fetches the HTML of each page and uses a specialized extraction node to strip away code, ads, and navigation, leaving only the high-value text content. SignUp using: dashboard.decodo.com/register?referral_code=55543bbdb96ffd8cf45c2605147641ee017e7900 [/dashboard.decodo.com/register/?referral_code=55543bbdb96ffd8cf45c2605147641ee017e7900]. 3. Vectorization & Storage: The cleaned text is passed to the Gemini Embedding model, which converts the information into 3076-dimensional vectors. These are stored in a Pinecone \"supportbot\" index for instant retrieval. 4. RAG-Powered Chat Agent: When a user sends a message through the chat widget, an AI Agent takes over. It uses the user's query to search the Pinecone database for relevant business facts. 5. Intelligent Response Generation: The AI Agent passes the retrieved facts and the current chat history to Google Gemini, which generates a polite, accurate, and contextually relevant response for the user.REQUIREMENTS * n8n Instance: A self-hosted or cloud instance of n8n. * Google Gemini API Key: For text embeddings and chat generation. * Pinecone Account: An API key and a \"supportbot\" index to store your knowledge base. * Decodo Access: For high-quality website content extraction.HOW TO USE 1. Initialize the Knowledge Base: Use the Form Trigger to input your website URL or Sitemap. Run the ingestion flow to populate your Pinecone index. 2. Configure Credentials: Authenticate your Google Gemini and Pinecone accounts within n8n. 3. Deploy the Chatbot: Enable the Chat Trigger node. Use the provided webhook URL to connect the backend to your website's frontend chat widget. 4. Test & Refine: Interact with the bot to ensure it retrieves the correct data, and update your knowledge base by re-running the ingestion flow whenever your website content changes.BUSINESS USE CASES * Customer Support Teams - Automate answers to 80% of common FAQs using your existing documentation. * E-commerce Sites - Help customers find product details, shipping policies, and return information instantly. * SaaS Providers - Build an interactive technical documentation assistant to help users navigate your software. * Marketing Agencies - Offer \"AI-powered site search\" as an add-on service for client websites.EFFICIENCY GAINS * Reduce Ticket Volume by providing instant self-service options. * Eliminate Manual Data Entry by scraping content directly from the live website. * Improve UX with 24/7 availability and zero wait times for customers.Difficulty Level: IntermediateEstimated Setup Time: 30 minMonthly Operating Cost: Low (variable based on AI usage and Pinecone tier)",
